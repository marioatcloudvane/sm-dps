# SM-DPS ‚Äî Super Mario Data Products Standard
The Data Product Standard to rule them all!

> _"Another Data Product standard? Yes. Because all the others fell into the lava."_  

Welcome to **SM-DPS**, the **Super Mario Data Products Standard** ‚Äî a bold, slightly ridiculous attempt to bring order, governance, and warp pipes to the chaotic world of data products.  
After reviewing 57 competing frameworks, 19 JSON schemas, and one suspicious PowerPoint deck titled *‚ÄúUltimate Data Mesh 3000‚Äù*, we came to the only logical conclusion:

**We still don‚Äôt have a standard that works. So we built our own.**

## üß© What is SM-DPS?

SM-DPS is a **functionally-believable** YAML-based standard for describing Data Products.  
It‚Äôs modeled after existing Standards but improved with **warp pipes, fire flowers, and stricter Bowser-compliance**.

You can finally define your data products with the confidence of a plumber holding a wrench and a dream.

```yaml
apiVersion: sm-dps/v1.0.0
kind: DataProduct
id: "sm-dps:dataproduct:world-1-1:mushroom-orders"
status: active

If that looks suspiciously like YAML you‚Äôve seen before ‚Äî yes, it is.
Except this one has coin budgets, warp zones, and thwomp-rate-limits baked in.
