# SM-DPS — Super Mario Data Products Standard
The Data Product Standard to rule them all!

> _"Another Data Product standard? Yes. Because all the others fell into the lava."_  

Welcome to **SM-DPS**, the **Super Mario Data Products Standard** — a bold, slightly ridiculous attempt to bring order, governance, and warp pipes to the chaotic world of data products.  
After reviewing 57 competing frameworks, 19 JSON schemas, and one suspicious PowerPoint deck titled *“Ultimate Data Mesh 3000”*, we came to the only logical conclusion:

**We still don’t have a standard that works. So we built our own.**

---

## What is SM-DPS?

SM-DPS is a **functionally-believable** YAML-based standard for describing Data Products.  
It’s modeled after existing Standards but improved with **warp pipes, fire flowers, and stricter Bowser-compliance**.

You can finally define your data products with the confidence of a plumber holding a wrench and a dream.

```yaml
apiVersion: sm-dps/v1.0.0
kind: DataProduct
id: "sm-dps:dataproduct:world-1-1:mushroom-orders"
status: active
```

If that looks suspiciously like YAML you’ve seen before — yes, it is.
Except this one has coin budgets, warp zones, and thwomp-rate-limits baked in.

## Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|------------|----------------|
|  **WarpPipe Ingestion** | Instantly moves data between worlds (a.k.a. environments) using advanced pipe-based teleportation. (we'll create a tool for that soon) |
|  **FireFlower Cache** | Provides ultra-hot query caching for your gold-tier tables. Sometimes literally on fire. |
|  **Starman Replica** | Grants temporary invincibility to workloads during Bowser-level traffic spikes. |
|  **Question Blocks** | Config toggles that may drop coins, schema changes, or unexpected nulls. |
|  **Coin Economy** | Built-in FinOps governance. Spend coins, not tears. |
|  **Peach Governance Model** | Three-level oversight: Executive = Peach, Strategic = Toad, Operational = Luigi. |
|  **Bowser Risk Register** | Tracks existential threats like castle outages and Koopa spikes with style. |
|  **Power-Up Metadata** | Extend your product definitions with FireFlowers, SuperStars, or 1-Up boosts. |
|  **WarpZone Deployment** | Skip CI queues entirely via secret tunnels (not guaranteed stable). |
|  **ThwompRateLimit** | Prevents uncontrolled redeploys by dropping heavy governance blocks on bad ideas. |
|  **Yoshi Integrations** | Out-of-the-box support for dashboards, catalogs, and dinosaur-friendly ETL. |
|  **Great Expectations Compatible** | Because even Mario checks his expectations before a boss fight. |

## Technical Details (because we need to sound serious)

* Format: YAML 1.2 (we think)
* Versioning: Semantic Versioning + World Number (e.g. v1.1.0-World-3)
* Schema: Validated by Great Expectations & Mario’s gut feeling
* Runtime Target: Databricks, Snowflake, or any silo with a stable bridge
* Testing: pytest --powerup=FireFlower
* CI/CD: green-shell-lint → red-shell-test → deploy via Warp Zone

## Contributing

 * Fork the repo.
 * Add your changes.
 * Pray to Yoshi for CI to pass.
 * Open a PR with a meme as justification.

We follow zero guidelines and occasionally merge at random to simulate real-world enterprise data governance.
